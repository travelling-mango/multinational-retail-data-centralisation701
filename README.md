## Project Overview
*The scenario*

A multinational company sells various goods across the globe. Currently, their sales data is spread across many different data sources - making it difficult to access and analyse. In an effort to become more data-driven, the company would like to make its sales data accessible from one centralised location.


*The solution*

The project solves the issues listed above by producing a system that stores the current company data in a database so that it can be accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for sales data.
The creation of a star-based schema and subsequent querying of the database in SQL provide up-to-date metrics for the business.
